			<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
			<p>Developing an algorithm with efficient Time complexity is crucial for optimizing program performance.</p>
			<p>Optimizing code for minimal memory usage is essential, considering Space Complexity and achieving O(n) efficiency. While designing the algorithm, it's important to consider the <b>Space Complexity</b> for efficient memory utilization.</p>
